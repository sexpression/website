**Are you passionate about using your skills and expertise to help support and develop a UK-wide relationships and sex education charity?**

Sexpression:UK is looking for one new trustee to join the existing Board immediately as well as a Chair Elect who will take over when our current Chair of Trustees steps down in June 2022.  

Sexpression:UK provides high quality, comprehensive relationships and sex education workshops to young people between the ages of 11-18 in schools and youth groups. We operate across the UK through our unique network of affiliated branches and volunteers based at universities and studentsâ€™ unions in 26 towns and cities from Aberdeen to Southampton.

You will have strong empathy with our mission to educate and empower young people to make individual, informed decisions about their bodies and their health. You will be committed to using your expertise to contribute to the future development of the charity and to ensure high quality governance.

We particularly welcome applications for the Trustee role from people with experience in secondary education management, quality assurance or data management. Applications for the Chair Elect role are sought from individuals with a strong background in charity governance and leadership with an understanding of the relationships and sex education sector being an additional desirable criteria but not essential for a successful application.
