## Director’s foreword
> It is my absolute delight to write this foreword for our first ever impact report. I am incredibly proud of our achievements this past academic year, and would like to extend acknowledgement and thanks to Eva Zilber, our 2019-2020 Branches Director for preparing this report.   
> Whilst the numbers in our impact report are impressive, from numbers of volunteers to the amount of sessions delivered, each number reflects countless hours of hard work, dedication, and passion for providing quality RSE. Sexpression:UK is student and volunteer-led, and as such, the continued growth of the charity is a result of tireless work at all levels - from branch volunteers, branch committees, National Committee, and our Trustees. It is from the bottom of my heart that I thank everyone who contributed to these successes; it wouldn’t have been possible without our nationwide, dedicated Sexpression:UK members at every level.

## 2019-20: the year at a glance

This year, there were ::28 official Sexpression:UK branches:: in England, Scotland, and Wales. During the year, ::2 branches closed:: due to lack of incoming committee (Hull, Keele), ::3 branches re-opened:: after a pause in their activity (Dundee, Exeter, UCL), and ::4 new branches:: were established* (Bath Spa, Birmingham, Brighton, Swansea). 
While some branches concentrated on society establishment, volunteer recruitment and training, and on-campus and advocacy work, ::18 branches had teaching activity::.
We had ::650 trained branch volunteers::. Together, they delivered 8925 young person sessions of relationships and sex education, ::reaching 6117 young people::.

### Our volunteers delivered sessions across all ages and covering all 6 Core Offer topics.

Over 90% of our sessions were delivered to single year groups. Like last year, the commonest group was 13-14 year olds, and ::most of our teaching was delivered to 13-16 year olds::. However, we saw a big rise in the proportion of teaching delivered to 11-13 year olds, from 7% last year to 18% this year.
70% of young person sessions concentrated on one Core Offer area, while the rest covered multiple topics. ::Safer Sex::was the most demanded, with 35% of sessions having it as one of their main topics. ::Sex and Consent::and ::**Relationships and Abuse**:: were included as main topics in 28% and 26% of sessions, respectively. Sex and the Media, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, and Bodily Changes - in 10-12% of sessions each.

## What do young people say?
We received **2758 feedback forms**, covering 31% of all young person sessions. 
**66%** of young people agreed or strongly agreed they had **learnt something** from the session. 
**60%** **felt better prepared to make decisions about sex and relationships**. This feedback varied depending on the main topic of the session, as shown below. 

We can see that young people learnt more in sessions focusing on a single Core Offer topic compared to sessions with several topics. 
Across all topics,**82%** of young people agreed or strongly agreed the session was **delivered well by the volunteers**.
**49%** of young people said they **wanted more sessions** from Sexpression. At the same time, the most common improvement suggestion young people had in their comments was to have **more time** and/or **more sessions** to cover relationships and sex education topics.
Overall, **Sexpression volunteers facilitate high quality educational sessions that young people self-reportedly enjoy and learn from.**

### Session Content
Young people highlighted **therelevanceof the sessions**,either specifically to that young person or in their opinion to the whole class, and how this **teaching filled a gap** in the usual provisions.

> We learnt lots about things we don’t usually cover in class  

> It clarified topics I actually had some questions about  

> It made me question and justify my beliefs  

Depending on session topic, young people most commonly identified the following learning points.

**Safer Sex**
* symptoms of STIs; 
* how to put on a condom; 
* how to use and/or make a dental dam; 
* how STIs can be transmitted; 
* how and where to get sexual health services or free condoms; 
* different methods of contraception and their effectiveness.

**Sex and Consent, Relationships and Abuse**
* nature and features of consent; 
* legal aspects of consent; 
* how to ask for, recognise, and give consent; 
* facts about sexual assault;
* types of abuse, including gaslighting; 
* how to identify a healthy and/or abusive relationship.

In **Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity** sessions, young people highlighted learning about different sexualities and gender identities, as well as the difficulties faced by the LGBTQ+ community, both historically and currently.

There weren’t enough comments to analyse learning points from Bodily Changes and Sex and The Media.

### Session atmosphere
Young people appreciated **interactive**, discussion and activity-based sessions, and often commended specific activities in their feedback. They enjoyed**working in small groups**, especially so with their friends, and appreciated the opportunity to discuss things they rarely talk about. The opportunity to ask a lot of questions, including anonymous questions, was also very important.

At the same time, young people valued the **atmosphere** of Sexpression sessions, with general positive feedback including “comfortable”, “relaxed”, “positive”, and “friendly”. More specifically, young people appreciated **openness**: both the honesty and openness of the volunteers, and also the opportunity to speak frankly themselves. The **non-judgemental** and **respectful** nature of our sessions and their **inclusivity** were also noted in many comments. Finally, the **safety** of our sessions was highlighted repeatedly by young people. This included the “no personal stories” ground rule, optional participation in activities, as well as generally being in a safe space.

> Was fun and didn’t feel under pressure  

> It was very casual, quite frank and easy to engage in  

> It felt like a discussion and it was slightly funny which made people feel more comfortable  

> All of us talked together about something we don’t really talk about  

> I was free to discuss any issues and ask questions  

> How open the volunteers were talking about the topics  

> The freedom of no right and wrong answers  

> everyone got their view said and tolerated  

> You could ask whatever you wanted without people judging you  

> lgbt representation  

> they were respectful and they didn’t embarrass you or make you do anything  

> Learning without uncovering personal information  

We see that **our principles highlighted in the Core Offer** - having comprehensive, open, non-judgemental, destigmatising, inclusive, and empowering sessions -**correspond well to what young people like about their relationships and sex education, and at the same time that our Branches are successfully delivering sessions in line with these principles**. 

## What do schools say?
We received feedback through a standard form from **14 teachers** who had worked with 6 different branches.
**Teachers were pleased with all aspects of sessions** delivered by our volunteers, with the following average scores out of 5:
* Organisation - **4.6**; 
* Range and level of content - **4.5**; 
* Opportunities for young people to ask questions - **4.7**; 
* Session delivery - **4.6**. 
**86%** of teachers said they were **very likely to recommend Sexpression workshops to their colleagues.**

> It was brilliant! Would 100% have them in again. The students were much more open and engaged hearing from the volunteers as opposed to staff…the volunteers were very much ‘on their level’ which prompted open discussion. Their honesty and willingness to acknowledge that it was an excitable topic meant the students got a lot out of it.

> Sessions are accessible, clear and have age appropriate content and activities. We had sessions on consent delivered to year 8 and the response from the children was very positive.  
12-13 year olds, session on Sex and Consent, Relationships and Abuse
Maxine Harty, PSHE Lead, Redland Green School

> RSE sessions delivered by young people have a far greater impact. Student volunteers were great at creating a safe space for discussion.

### Training and Development
Throughout the year, Sexpression:UK provides essential training and further development opportunities to our volunteers.

In October, Sexpression:Manchester and Sexpression:UEA hosted our annual **Training for Trainers weekends** where 43 branch child protection and training officers (at least one representative per branch) prepared to train their branch volunteers and received Child Protection Training. 

Workshops there were run by Sexpression:UK Training and Child Protection Directors, and a range of external speakers.

In January - June, our **Training Director** provided **a further running programme of online workshops**aimed at training officers, covering topics from Sexpression:UK Core Offer: Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, Pregnancy, Consent, and workshop planning. 

In November, Sexpression:Cardiff hosted our annual **National Conference**, which was an opportunity for volunteers to come together for a weekend of talks and workshops from various external speakers in the RSE and related fields

In April, National Committee provided a wide range of workshops during our **General Assembly,**which had to be moved online due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Topics were relevant to all volunteers, including leadership and teamwork, classroom techniques and lesson planning, Child Protection, social media use and working with the media, and fundraising.

Overall, 15 workshops were attended by 87 volunteers. 96% of the feedback survey respondents said they were likely to recommend a Sexpression:UK workshop to another volunteer or a friend based on their experience. In their comments, our volunteers said they found the sessions useful and enjoyable, despite the unusual online format of the General Assembly.

> We were given really useful / interesting information from the facilitator, followed by everyone being invited to contribute and share their own ideas, which made them incredibly valuable and worthwhile.   

> We had some really interesting discussions - facilitated excellently over Zoom.  

## Where are these data from?
Monitoring and evaluation data is collected by Sexpression:UK in a variety of ways. 

**Outputs**
The number and topic of sessions, the number of young people attending and their ages were reported by branches directly after teaching sessions. Information about National Committee-run event attendance was collected by the relevant National Committee members. 

**Young people’s outcomes**
Feedback from young people was collected using a standard feedback form, either paper or electronic. They asked YP to express to what extent (on a scale of 1-5) they agree with the following 4 statements: “I learnt something from the session”, “I feel more prepared to make decisions about sex and relationships”, “I’d like more sessions from Sexpression”, “I feel the session volunteers delivered the session well”. 

When reporting results, we used “agreed” or “agreed or strongly agreed” to indicate the proportion of YP who gave a rating of 4/5 or 5/5 for a given question. 

There was also space for free responses to questions “What went well about the session?” or “What did you enjoy about the session?” (depending on the version of the form used), “What could we improve?”, “What did you learn?”, and a space for other comments. Overall, we received over 1500 comments, and these were analysed to find recurrent themes, and selected representative comments were included in the report. 

**Teacher outcomes**
Feedback from teachers was obtained via a single feedback form distributed by branches to their contacts within schools and youth groups at the end of the academic year. Teachers were asked to indicate how likely they are to recommend Sexpression sessions to another school or youth group on a scale 1-10, and we used “very likely” to indicate an answer of 9 or 10. They were then asked to indicate how satisfied they were with various aspects of the sessions on a scale 1-5. There was also space for free responses to questions “What did you like about working with Sexpression and the sessions our volunteers delivered?”, and “What could we improve on?”. Representative quotes were selected from answers to these questions and consent obtained to include them in this report.
