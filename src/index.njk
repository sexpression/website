"about": "Since forming in 2000, Sexpression members from over 25 university branches have been delivering teaching to 11-18-year olds in schools and community groups providing informative, open and engaging relationships, sex and health education. Although originally founded by a group of medical students at University College London, Sexpression:UK has since expanded to train volunteers from all university courses, in order to capture the diverse perspectives that these students can offer."
