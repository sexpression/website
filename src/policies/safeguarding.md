# Safeguarding Policy

Updated 01/02/2021

Reviewed 01/02/2021

## Foreword
[Link](#Foreword)

Sexpression:UK is a near-peer, student led independent UK charity that provides Relationships, Sex and Health Education (RSHE) by running informal and comprehensive RSHE in the community, with the goal of empowering young people to make decisions about relationships and sex. Our branches work predominantly in secondary schools but have been invited to work in other locations such as youth groups, community centres, and with university groups.

We understand that we have a fundamental duty of care towards the young people we work with therefore this Safeguarding Policy (formerly known as Child Protection Policy) aims to ensure that all volunteers feel capable to preserve and promote the health and wellbeing of these young people.

The review of this policy takes place regularly over a series of meetings and consultations with volunteers for Sexpression:UK as well as professionals from external organisations. As a result of this consultative process there are continual changes to how Sexpression:UK as an organisation addresses Safeguarding when compared to the initial policy presented in 2007. Consequently, there are continual changes to how our volunteers as individuals are trained in order to reflect this policy, and annual training is compulsory for all volunteers working with young people.

We recognise that as near-peer external RSHE providers delivering discussion based participatory sessions, we are often in a unique position to recognize Child Protection issues. Our volunteers require the training and skills which provide them with the ability to become aware of situations that indicate there is an issue to be addressed, which may be through direct interaction with a young person or from indirect observation and subsequent suspicion. It is in these circumstances that individuals and Sexpression:UK have a duty of care in ensuring any concerns are addressed, and that this information is shared promptly and appropriately with our partner organisations.

The renaming of this Policy in  2021  from Child Protection Policy to Safeguarding Policy aims to underline our commitment to Safeguarding as a whole and to bring our language in line with the standard in the sector.

## Introduction
[Introduction](#introduction)

As defined by the Government Document ‘Working Together to Safeguard Children’ 2018, abuse and neglect are forms of maltreatment of a child by inflicting harm, or by failing to act to prevent harm. Abuse can occur in a family or an institutional or community setting by those known to them or, more rarely, by others. Abuse can also take place online. Child abuse can take many forms:

### Physical abuse
[Physical abuse](#physical-abuse)

Physical abuse may involve hitting, shaking, throwing, poisoning, burning or scalding, drowning, suffocating, or otherwise causing physical harm to a child. Physical harm may also be caused when a parent or carer fabricates the symptoms of, or deliberately induces, illness in a child.

### Sexual abuse
[Sexual abuse](#sexual-abuse)

Sexual abuse involves making or enticing a child to partake in sexual activities, not necessarily involving a high level of violence, whether or not the child is aware of what is happening. It may involve physical contact, including assault by penetration, or non-physical contact such as having children look at or take part in the production of sexual images, watching sexual activities, or grooming. Sexual abuse can also take place online and technology can be used to facilitate offline abuse.

### Emotional abuse
[Link](#emotional-abuse)

Emotional abuse is the persistent emotional maltreatment of a child which can cause severe and persistent adverse effects on the child’s emotional development. It can involve conveying that they are worthless, inadequate or unloved. It may include interactions beyond a child’s developmental capability, as well as overprotection and limitation of exploration and learning. It may involve seeing or hearing the ill-treatment of another, serious bullying, causing children to feel frightened or in danger. Some level of emotional abuse is involved in all types of maltreatment of a child, though it may occur alone.


### Neglect
Neglect is the persistent failure to meet a child’s basic physical and/or psychological needs, likely to result in the serious impairment of the child’s health or development. Neglect may involve a parent or carer failing to provide adequate food, clothing or shelter, protect a child from physical and emotional harm or danger, ensure adequate supervision or ensure access to appropriate medical care or treatment. It may also include neglect of, or unresponsiveness to, a child’s basic emotional needs.

Sexpression:UK believes that concern for the general wellbeing and welfare of all young people who are in contact with our charity is of paramount importance. We believe that every child has a right to feel safe and protected from any activity which may result in them being exposed to significant harm. All our volunteers will have a duty of care, should they have concerns that a child is being exposed to physical, sexual, neglect or emotional abuse. The purpose of this document is to explain clearly, for volunteers involved in Sexpression:UK and its affiliated branches as well as affiliated organisations, the principles of Safeguarding. It is intended to cover those issues of the utmost importance in order to ensure the following:

### The protection of young people
Although Sexpression:UK and its volunteers cannot guarantee the complete protection of young people, this document aims to ensure that should any evidence of a Safeguarding issue arise that it is addressed appropriately to guarantee the protection of the young person;
### The protection of volunteers
This document provides guidance and support for the volunteers who may become aware of a Safeguarding issue and aims to aid them in their response to this;

### The protection of Sexpression:UK
The dissemination and implementation of this policy illustrates our commitment to safeguarding the young people we work with.

Although it is acknowledged that this document does not necessarily provide volunteers with the complete ability to ensure the safety of young people, it does give a forum for discussion and the sharing of skills and experiences to ensure that young people are protected to the best of their abilities, and outlines the charity’s expectations, actions and policy.

   5. To ensure this policy is maintained to a high standard it must be reviewed annually by the current National Committee.
   6. The Sexpression:UK National Child Protection Director:
      1. This role is currently provided by the Sexpression:UK Child Protection Director (​childprotection@sexpression.org.uk​).

**2. Implementation**
   1. The Sexpression:UK trustees have the ultimate responsibility for ensuring adequate levels of safeguarding training is provided and that this policy is implemented throughout the Sexpression:UK network.
      1. The board of trustees elects a designated Safeguarding Trustee to oversee this on behalf of trustees.
   2. The Sexpression:UK National Child Protection Director (NCPD) is the named individual responsible for ensuring the distribution of this policy, its implementation and the provision of adequate levels of Child Protection training throughout Sexpression:UK.

**3. Reporting Procedures**
   1. Issues concerning child abuse or neglect may become established in a number of ways, not limited to but including:
      1. The child may directly disclose the information;
      2. The child may have visible marks on their skin;
      3. A child may directly disclose information concerning another child;
      4. An allegation may be made against a volunteer;
      5. Suspicions arise concerning the child’s behavior.
   2. Should any of the above situations arise it is important to:
      1. Act calmly, listen with care and consideration and show that you are taking the situation seriously;
      2. Find an appropriate time in the conversation to explain that they were right to tell you but that confidentiality cannot be promised;
      3. Keep questions to a minimum and ensure that you only ask open questions. Never ask leading questions. It is not the job of an individual volunteer to investigate;
      4. Take all disclosures seriously. Always ensure that you are listening to the voice of the child;
      5. Ensure that a minimum of two volunteers are present when a child is making a disclosure;
      6. Inform the child of the actions that the volunteer will take after disclosure and, preferably, obtain consent from them for this action;
         1. If you have significant concerns about a child’s safety then you do not need to obtain consent for the actions taken after disclosure.
   3. The following reporting procedures must be followed for any safeguarding concern or allegation experience by a volunteer:
      1. Complete a Sexpression:UK Child Protection Incident Reporting Form (see Appendix) as soon as possible.
         1. All information regarding the concern or allegation must be recorded.
         2. This information must be factual in origin and written verbatim to include quotes of exact phrases.
         3. All written information must be signed and dated.
         4. If a form is not readily available, record on paper immediately and transfer the information at the earliest opportunity.
      2. Inform the BCPO as soon as possible.
         1. Always refer and never investigate any suspicions or allegations about abuse.
         2. Provide the BCPO with the paper copy of the incident form within 24 hours.
         3. If you are not able to provide the BCPO with a copy of the paper incident form within  24  hours, provide photographs of the incident form and any supporting evidence in a secure, password-protected way.
         4. Once this has been reported, ensure all photographs of the incident are deleted off devices.
   4. The BCPO or lead volunteer appointed prior to the visit if the BCPO is unable to attend the teaching day, is responsible for dealing with the issue from the local Sexpression:UK Branch perspective and must do the following:
      1. Inform the DSL at the school or centre you are working in.
         1. If the DSL is not available, inform the next available safeguarding lead.
         2. Ensure that the incident is only discussed with appointed safeguarding leads of the school or centre you are working in and no other member of staff.
         3. Tell them what has happened.
         4. Give them a copy of the Child Protection Incident Reporting Form and any other evidence to photocopy as soon as possible.
         5. Ensure that you retain the original copy of the incident form for Sexpression: UK records.
      2. If the BCPO is not present at the visit, the lead volunteer must inform the BCPO within 24  hours of the incident occurring, following the steps outlined in section 3.3.2.
      3. The BCPO must inform the NCPD.

         2. The online reporting form must be filled out verbatim with what is written on the paper copy of the incident form.
         3. A photograph of the paper incident form must be attached to the online reporting form.
   5. The NCPD must report the incident to the institution within 24 hours of receiving the information and follow the incident up until closure.
      1. The incident will be closed once the NCPD has confirmed that information about the incident has been documented and that a decision about appropriate action or lack thereof has been made.
      2. The NCPD will aim to follow up with a  48  hour interval, and always within  2  weeks of the previous communication. Where appropriate, the NCPD may also use other ways of reaching the DSL, such as phoning the school.
      3. All incidents must be closed by the end of the academic year in which they were raised.
   6. Managing and Storing information:
      1. Completed Child Protection Incident Reporting Forms should be treated as confidential documents.
      2. Access to confidential documents must be restricted to the BCPO, DSL, NCPD, Sexpression:UK’s National Director, Safeguarding Trustee, and Chair of the Board of Trustees.
         1. These named individuals must understand their obligation to handle such information in a confidential manner.
      3. BCPO must keep paper copies of the incident form for the remainder of the academic year.
         1. These records must be stored in secure, non-transportable storage with access controlled and limited to the person they are in possession of.
      4. Online records of Child Protection Incidents will be kept on Sexpression: UK’s secure, password protected, encrypted cloud with access limited to the person(s) stated in section 3.5.2. In the interest of safeguarding, they will be kept for a minimum period of 7 years.
      5. The Data Protection Act (2018) permits the sharing of confidential information without consent where it is considered necessary to safeguard a child or young person.
   7. For a diagrammatic interpretation of the above information please see Figure 1 (below).

    Figure 1: Incident Reporting Procedure

**4. Response Procedures**
   1. It is not the responsibility of anyone involved in Sexpression:UK to investigate whether or not child abuse has taken place. It is their responsibility to ensure concerns are passed on to the appropriate parties.
   2. Action taken must be individualised and will differ accordingly to:
      1. Nature of the complaint;
      2. Nature of the setting the Sexpression:UK Branch is working in.
   3. The NCPD will confirm with the branch involved that their report has been received and passed on to the appropriate party.
   4. The NCPD will ensure the report has been followed up with the external organisation involved and inform the branch involved of when the incident is closed​.

**5. Safeguarding ​ Allegations Against Volunteers**
   1. If, as a volunteer, you have a safeguarding concern about another volunteer, you must report this to your Branch Coordinator.
      1. The Branch Coordinator should then report this issue to the NCPD.
      2. If the safeguarding concern is regarding the Branch Coordinator, the volunteer should consult with the NCPD directly and the steps outlined in Section 5.2 will be taken.
   2. On receiving an allegation, the Sexpression:UK NCPD will initiate an internal enquiry.
   3. The NCPD will consult with the National Director and if necessary, the trustees, to decide on the most appropriate cause of action.
      1. The NCPD will inform the DSLs of external organisations involved should any evidence of harm be found.
      2. This may involve liaison with statutory organisations.
   4. The volunteer will be immediately suspended from all work involving Sexpression:UK until the issue has been resolved.
      1. Volunteers may be removed from their role should they hold one on a branch committee should evidence of misconduct be found.
      2. Volunteers may be banned from partaking in any teaching through Sexpression:UK and will have their membership revoked should evidence of misconduct be found.
      3. Should no evidence of direct harm or misconduct be found, volunteers can resume all work involving Sexpression:UK once the investigation has been closed.

**6. Prevention**
   1. Volunteer recruitment:
      1. Sexpression:UK recognises the fact that anyone may have the potential to abuse children and as such, Sexpression:UK must take steps to ensure that unsuitable people are prevented from working with Sexpression:UK.
         1. It is the responsibility of the BCPO to ensure all Sexpression:UK volunteers, in their Branch, have an acceptable extended Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) or Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) check, including barred lists.
            1. The Sexpression:UK NCPD can offer assistance on obtaining this, if required.
            2. An equivalent, such as the Scottish Protection of Vulnerable Groups background check, is also acceptable.
         2. The NCPD may use the DBS Update Service to access avolunteer’s most recent DBS Status each year they continueto volunteer for Sexpression:UK, with their consent. This willaddress any uncertainty in Status during the period betweennew DBS checks.
            1. Volunteers must register themselves (for free) within  30  days of receiving their Certificate in orderto use this service, thus the BCPO should encourage their volunteers to do this.
               1. Volunteers will still require a new Certificate every 3 years from the date of issue.
         3. Until such screening has been completed no volunteer will be allowed to work with children in Sexpression:UK.
         4. Each Sexpression:UK BCPO must return details of Sexpression:UK volunteers DBS/PVG checks listed on their annual CP register at least  48  hours before the volunteer goes in to teach using the appropriate submission system.
   2. Volunteer training:
      1. Any concerns highlighted in the training of a Sexpression:UK volunteer must be communicated from the BCPO to the NCPD and will be addressed accordingly.
   3. Guidance for volunteers:
      1. Photos must not be taken during work with children and Sexpression:UK.
      2. Do not give out personal contact details to children.
      3. Do not disclose personal information to children.
   4. Expectations of the volunteer:
      1. Sexpression:UK volunteers should aim for diversity between volunteers as best as possible during teaching days.
      2. It is compulsory that a teacher or teaching assistant is present throughout the teaching session at all times.
      3. It is compulsory for a minimum of two Sexpression:UK volunteers to be present at a session, with one of those volunteers having sufficient experience to lead. If this is difficult to achieve , you must contact the National Child Protection Director before the session takes place to seek advice.
         1. If a Sexpression:UK volunteer is leading a session alone due to unforeseen circumstances, it is compulsory for a teacher or teaching assistant to be present throughout the teaching session at all times.
         2. If a Sexpression:UK volunteer is leading a session alone due to unforeseen circumstances, it is compulsory for this volunteer to inform the National Committee as soon as possible.
      4. Sexpression:UK volunteers are expected to act professionally when in a school, as they ought to in any other educational setting.

**7. Working with Sexpression:UK Partner Organisations**
   1. Safeguarding policy and procedures should form an essential part of all Sexpression:UK partnership agreements.
   2. The Sexpression:UK Safeguarding Policy should be actively promoted to all Sexpression:UK partner organisations.
   3. There should be a process of engagement with Sexpression:UK partner organisations on safeguarding issues to ensure mutual learning and development of good practice.
   4. Sexpression:UK partner organisations should be encouraged to develop their own Safeguarding policies.
   5. Partner organisations should be encouraged to give feedback on Sexpression:UK’s Safeguarding policy.

**8. Disclosures of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)**
   1. In England and Wales, the law requires certain professional groups to report to the police if a child discloses that they have had FGM carried out on them.
   2. Volunteers are not included in this professional group.
   3. Any disclosure or suspicion of FGM should be reported by completing a Child Protection Incident Form and following standard procedure.
   4. This law does not apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Any disclosures of FGM by a child in Scotland or Northern Ireland should be reported using a Child Protection Incident Form.
   5. FGM training is mandatory for Sexpression:UK volunteers and resources for further information must be made available to branches.
