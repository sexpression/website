                                year’s Fundraising Director. I started with Sexpression in 2014 at the Newcastle branch
                                where I’ve been Training Coordinator, Branch Coordinator, as well as on the 2015
                                National Conference organising committee and this will my 6th year. The Finance role is
                                mostly behind-the-scenes but I am more than happy to lend a hand with any projects or
                                exciting ideas that may come up so please don’t hesitate to reach out! My goal this year
                                is to continue Joanna’s work and lead our migration into a new and streamlined finance
                                and banking process so that in the future, we can continue to work more efficiently and
                                responsively with branches and our partners. It’s been an amazing and fruitful journey
                                and I am excited to continue growing with Sexpression in the upcoming year!</p>

I started life with Sexpression at the Lancaster branch in 2015. Since then I have been the training officer, child protection officer and this year the co-chair of the Manchester branch. I really enjoy teaching RSE as I think it’s so important to prepare young people, especially in an ever changing world! My role involves child protection, safeguarding, and being the port of call for anything DBS/PVG related. I love working with Sexpression and I’m very excited to be part of the national committee this year!</p>
