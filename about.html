                                volunteering with Sexpression:UK (I’ve been a part of Manchester, Oxford, and Warwick

                                was previously the finance director on national committee. This year I am aiming to
                                forge new
                                relationships and collaborations with external organisations, and spread
                                Sexpression:UK’s message, so
                                more people can hear all about the incredible work that we do!</p>

                                Sexpression:Oxford since first year. I think all young people should have access to

                                Sexpression:UK
                                volunteers I&#x27;ve worked alongside over these years, and from various roles I&#x27;ve

                                to supporting our branches all over the UK in the amazing work that they do, and

                                year’s Fundraising Director. I started with Sexpression in 2014 at the Newcastle branch
                                where I’ve been Training Coordinator, Branch Coordinator, as well as on the 2015
                                National Conference organising committee and this will my 6th year. The Finance role is
                                mostly behind-the-scenes but I am more than happy to lend a hand with any projects or
                                exciting ideas that may come up so please don’t hesitate to reach out! My goal this year
                                is to continue Joanna’s work and lead our migration into a new and streamlined finance
                                and banking process so that in the future, we can continue to work more efficiently and
                                responsively with branches and our partners. It’s been an amazing and fruitful journey
                                and I am excited to continue growing with Sexpression in the upcoming year!</p>

                                volunteering for Sexpression:UK. I dove right in, onto the committee of the Manchester

                                fresher and went on to chair the branch. I am excited to now be involved on a national

                                our communications and overseeing social media. With the ever growing importance of an
